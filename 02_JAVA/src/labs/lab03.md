## Lab 03 -    (Numbers) Divisible by 3, 5, 15
            //    Write a program that can print the numbers between 1 ~ 100 that can be divisible by 3, 5, and 15.
            //
            //            if the number can be divisible by 3, 5 and 15, then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy15' section
            //
            //            if the number can be divisible by 3 but cannot be divisible by 15, then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy3' section
            //
            //            if the number can be divisible by 5 but cannot be divisible by 15, then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy5' section
            //
