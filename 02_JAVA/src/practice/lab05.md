## Lab 05 - If-else
___

Create a program that uses if-else logic to create a program that chooses true or false.

## Objective
Homework
### Any year that is evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year: for example, 1988, 1992, and 1996 are leap years.
* However, there is still a small error that must be accounted for. To eliminate this error, the Gregorian calendar stipulates that a year that is evenly divisible by 100 (for example, 1900) is a leap year only if it is also evenly divisible by 400.
* For this reason, the following years are not leap years:
  1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600
  This is because they are evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400.
  The following years are leap years: 1600, 2000, 2400
  This is because they are evenly divisible by both 100 and 400.
  WAP to tell whether a given year is a leap year or not
